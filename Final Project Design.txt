Using the structure we have learned all semester about programming with classes we will program a game called Mining Madness.

The object of the game is to mine minerals with the goal of mining either:
5000 coal
2000 silver
1000 gold
or
500 platinum

Once any of these goals is reached, the player wins. Coal will be the easiest to find, but you need to mine a lot of it.

Maintainability will be achieved through:
Proper folder structure
Carful use of classes using the principles of encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance
Careful commenting of code
Refactoring of code to make sure it's readable and efficient

Classes unique to this game will be:
MineralField()
	(variables)
	_mineral_type
	_point_value
	_mineral_amount

Miner()
	(variables)
	_body
	_animation
